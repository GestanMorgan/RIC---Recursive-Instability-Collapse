# Recursive Instability Collapse (RIC)

A theoretical framework proposing that quantum collapse, conscious decision-making, and cosmic expansion arise from a common principle: systems collapse when maintaining indecision becomes too costly.

## Overview

This paper introduces RIC as an adaptive monitoring principle for open quantum systems. The framework suggests that a global instability functional modulates measurement strengths, while maintaining linear GKLS/Lindblad dynamics.

## Key Features

- Mathematical formalization using established quantum mechanics (GKLS/Lindblad dynamics)
- Testable predictions for quantum trajectories and EEG signatures  
- Simulation pseudocode included
- Cosmological implications (heuristic reading as dark energy component)

## Collaboration Note

This work was developed through extensive collaboration with AI systems (Claude 4.1 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 Thinking), which performed the mathematical formalization and technical drafting. The conceptual framework and philosophical foundations are by the human author.

## Status

**Preprint** - Seeking feedback on mathematical consistency and experimental feasibility.
